                <p class="Para_1">
                    These quarantine days help me to pick up a new habit: Running. I have been inspired after reading the book, 
                    “What I talk about when I talk about running” by the Japanese author Haruki Murakami. Murakami tells about 
                    his journey to participate in marathons by running every day, even how busy he is. And how running makes 
                    him into a better person: better health, better work productiveness, and better life enjoyment. The texts 
                    have been my underlying motivation to try running and see what is in it for me. <br>
                    <br>
                    It is actually so simple to start running. It requires much less equipment and gears like some other 
                    activities and surely doesn’t need you to collect more than ten other people like for a soccer match. 
                    That is running’s convenience. You just start running. Or like me looking for a great trainer because 
                    I want to make this habit serious. But however prepared you are, the beginning is always difficult. I 
                    found a great trail that has few intersections or constructions and great views of my campus at UTD. 
                    The first day is great, and I just ran with all efforts I had. And it felt like on top of the world 
                    when you got home and feel really satisfied. The second day, well, okay. On the third day, I become 
                    so tired that I walk for the most part. And the fourth day, I ended up sleeping in until 9.<br>
                    <br>
                    While I was struggling to develop a good schedule, my housemate suddenly invited me to train with 
                    him because he also had a long time interest in running. And he found all knowledge one should know
                    about running for me (he is a Ph.D. in CS, so basically researching is his thing) and a schedule 
                    for beginners that should fit us just fine to get a head start. We all agreed on everything in 
                    two days and started running the day after. <br>
                    <br>
                    Now we have reached our second week in training, and today I run for 4 minutes straight, 
                    then walk four minutes, and repeat four times. I feel that my body is gradually adapting 
                    to the run and getting a little better than yesterday. After all, the most critical measure 
                    is “better than yourself yesterday.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Maybe it seems a little bit too trivial to mention, but all of these things would not have 
                    happened if I had not picked up my lazy body every morning that very first week to go running. 
                    And my friend would never offer me to start training with him, which helps me a lot for having 
                    another partner to get me up and endure the painful parts of the journey. It was truly wonderful 
                    to finally experience and understand the famous quote from “The Alchemist,” <br>
                    <br>
                    <b><i>When you want something, all the universe conspires in helping you to achieve it.</i></b>
                    – Paulo Coelho (The Alchemist) <br>
                    <br>
                    I hope you also have something in your mind that you truly want to achieve. And you will finally 
                    achieve it, it all starts with you. Stay hungry and curious~
                    Hope you have a great day!<br>
                    <br>
                    Love always,<br>
                    Son
