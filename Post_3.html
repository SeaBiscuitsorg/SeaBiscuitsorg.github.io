                    If I have to choose a book that helps me overcome challenging days in the past, it would be 
                    <b>“Love for Imperfect Things: How to Accept Yourself in a World Striving for Perfection”</b> by 
                    <b>Haemin Sunim</b>. It is a self-help book written by a Buddhist monk, but it is not about religion. 
                    While Haemin Sunim does include many meaningful insights from Buddhism, he keeps the texts of 
                    his book familiar and informal to reach a wide range of readers. The book is not a philosophical 
                    text but more like a piece of advice on how to live a happy and fulfilled life. <br>
                    <br>
                    Firstly, Haemin Sunim wants to touch a large part of society considered “good” by the majority. 
                    A good child, a good student, a good friend. They are all relative terms. But Sunim has pointed 
                    out that we consider someone “good” because the person complied with others’ will and is not self-assertive. 
                    We see someone good mostly because they can suppress their desires in deference to others. But is this 
                    really a “good” person? Is he/she happy while being a good person? This is the first question that Sunim 
                    wants to clarify in his book. And the answer is surprising: Many good people do not live their lives so 
                    happily. They spend so much time thinking of others instead of expressing their own will. They may not 
                    even consider themselves “good” because they are merely trying desperately to conform to everyone, 
                    although we cannot and should not make everyone in the world like us. These self-judgments eventually 
                    make them depressed and anxious all the time. This type of person is not uncommon nowadays when parents 
                    and schools’ education directly encourage their children and students to listen and do what they are taught. <br>
                    <br>
                    The change is not impossible. It does not have to be significant and enormous changes. It can start just from 
                    everyday situations like telling other people what you truly want to do instead of always following what you 
                    are said. You need to be kind to yourself first. Isn’t that what we are told to do to put on our oxygen mask 
                    before helping others when there is an airplane emergency? The same principle applies to our life. After all, 
                    it is not selfish at all to take care of ourselves first.<br>
                    <br>
                    The rest of the book is various useful insights about different aspects of our life like family, relationships, 
                    work, and study. Haemin Sunim has succeeded in helping people heal their wounds and hurt feelings in this chaotic 
                    modern world. His words are like the arms of a beloved mother who always welcomes her children no matter what they 
                    do, how successful they are, or how failure they consider themselves to be. In 2018, there were 48,344 recorded 
                    suicides in the United States. The number is alarming to governments and health administrators around the world.
                    We usually ignore these numbers and try to cover them with our default thinking like: These are just very rare 
                    in society. We are ordinary people, so it would be ok. Not until one day, the coworker who usually sits next to 
                    us disappeared when we realized how ignorant we had been to this social issue.<br>
                    <br>
                    The book is a valuable source to read, especially in this uncertain time when pandemics and protests are happening
                    all over the US. The waves of anxiety, hatred, and anger are spreading fast and indirectly kill people. Hopefully, 
                    after reading this book, you will have another view about your life and others’, so that you can be the one who has 
                    positive effects on the people around you. If every one of us may acknowledge that, we can all make the world 
                    a better place. <br>
                    <br>
                    If you feel like this book fits you, then you can also check out another book by Haemin Sunim that I also keep with 
                    me ever since I bought it, <b>“The Things You Can See Only When You Slow Down: How to Be Calm and Mindful in a Fast-Paced World.”</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I hope what you read will console you somehow with all the good and bad things that are happening around you. 
                    And you will find yourself a quiet corner of the house to enjoy this beautiful book. <br>
                    <br>
                    Love always,<br>
                    Son
