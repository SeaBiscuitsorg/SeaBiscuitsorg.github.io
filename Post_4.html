                    Meditation has been all over the place. People nowadays talk about it like magical 
                    medicine that can cure many mental issues and improve our health in general. 
                    Let me tell you how I started meditating and how it plays a very 
                    important role in my daily life. <br>
                    <br>
                    I first knew about meditation when I was small and watched many Chinese films that 
                    had a monk meditated day and night until he attained superpower. Meditation has 
                    been a myth for me because no one around me does it. People also see it as only 
                    for Buddhist monks and that it is such a pointless and lazy thing to do while we 
                    have so many things in this world to do (but ironically, we spent our time watching 
                    even more pointless TV shows). So, in short, I did not see meditation like it is nowadays.<br>
                    <br>
                    It was when I was in my 10th grade that I discovered why do people meditate. At that time, 
                    I am a normal boy growing up quite happily despite my reserved character. I considered myself 
                    quite balanced in some way. But it all started to feel very different when I was in high school. 
                    It was not because I was stressed out because of studying or anything. It was the change from a 
                    boy to a man, from a very dependent child to a grown-up. And it was hard. It first started with 
                    the fact that I have to do many things on my own. I also started to know more about the world 
                    around me. And as I became more aware of it, I became more scared too. I felt the world a not 
                    very funny and playful place like before. I knew more about the darker sides of life. I learned 
                    that many people are suffering in this world. And sometimes there is nothing I can do to help them. 
                    I learned that there aren’t so many equalities in this world. Evil does not always lose to justice. 
                    And again, a small child like me may not change all these problems.<br>
                    <br>
                    I started to feel less positive about everything. I began to question all things I have done 
                    previously to see if I was a bad guy without even realizing it. I started to understand that 
                    people sometimes are selfish, and no one is supposed to help others if they don’t have to. 
                    It may sound strange to you, but I think these are significant facts that you grew up being 
                    taught the other way around. These thoughts continued to bother me as I continued to try to 
                    push them away. But the more efforts I put in, the more similar thoughts came to my mind. 
                    And the more frustrating I felt about myself. And the more ugly I see myself, the more 
                    critical I am. It just creates a vicious cycle that makes me restless and leaves me no 
                    room to breathe, not to say being more positive.<br>
                    <br>
                    But every catastrophe has its meaning: To make us realize our problems to solve. And I 
                    started to learn all my issues are in my mind. Only then I started to look for ways to 
                    “control” my mind. I literally searched, “How to stop thoughts.” And the advice to try 
                    meditation got me curious. I remembered seeing monks meditate for days and wonder if it 
                    is the right medicine for my condition. I went on YouTube and search for meditation in 
                    Vietnamese. You know, Vietnamese has a big community of Buddhists, so when I search that 
                    word, instead of things you would have if you search in English like Therapy and yoga, 
                    I will look at many Buddhism teachings about meditation. And one video I found that got 
                    me is from a widely known Vietnamese Buddhist named “Thich Nhat Hanh.” You might know 
                    him as an activist for a non-violent campaign in the Vietnam war. His message is somewhat 
                    similar to Indian lawyer Mahatma Gandhi. The video, I have to say, made me feel the sense 
                    of peacefulness and happiness that I had ever experienced. I was moved by his simple way 
                    of living and his insights. I realized that I had to give meditation, in this case, 
                    mindfulness meditation, a try if I want to make a permanent change in my daily life.<br>
                    <br>
                    I started easy, with many breathing exercises that “Thay” (that is what they called 
                    Thich Nhat Hanh) guided. Simply pay attention to the breath, and count from 1 to 10. 
                    As easy as kindergarten, right? No, it is not. I always lose my count from 5 because 
                    my mind would go to other places and other things I want to do after the practice. 
                    Sometimes, that feeling is so big that I quit altogether, feeling frustrated and 
                    wondered if this is not for me. There are good days, too—days when I experienced 
                    much happiness and peacefulness. When I feel like I have so much energy and a positive 
                    attitude, and gradually, the bad days became much more bearable, with me knowing 
                    how to turn back to my breath each time I feel like I will be overwhelmed. Although 
                    I would still lose my count from time to time, I can do ten breaths without 
                    interruption of thoughts and emotions.<br>
                    <br>
                    As I know more about meditation, I also wanted to know what other people think 
                    about this and try my search in English. As you may guess, the results are many 
                    ads for mediation apps, as well as many articles discussing how meditation benefits 
                    your mind and body. I found an app with this very cute animation, Headspace, 
                    to try out because I started to feel like Thay’s simple breathing exercise 
                    became more routine. And I am not disappointed that I have tried Headspace 
                    because the philosophy of Headspace is also straightforward as Thay’s teaching. 
                    It even has the animation that attracts me and no argument for Andy’s voice (the 
                    man who creates Headspace). Andy was a formal monk, so his ideas behind these 
                    meditations are somewhat on the same page with what I learned from Thay. Headspace 
                    provides value for users because it guides people with different challenges 
                    throughout the experience. Things like efforts in meditation, how to set aside 
                    time, what is the right way to sit, and how to come back if you missed some days. 
                    It also had a big community on Facebook that shares their experiences and meditates 
                    together as Headspace Buddies. The page helps me a lot since I do not find my hobby
                    anywhere among my same-age friends :). Even my parents never know about this because 
                    I believe they would think I am crazy.<br>
                    <br>
                    So, that is how I start meditating three years ago. I have completed until now 6,000 
                    minutes of meditation with the Headspace app. Although I still had 1 or 2 days a 
                    week that I felt not well and my mind would go over the roof, I also experienced 
                    days that I felt undefeatable and truly happy with my mind. My plan now would be 
                    to make meditation a routine in everyday life. Until now, I would just day in day 
                    out with the practice without committing a time in the day when I can do it regularly.<br>
                    <br>
                    I will not assure you that you would find meditation as helpful as I see it myself. 
                    But I do ensure you that you will not waste your time and energy in something like 
                    meditation. So why not give it a try, and give yourself quality time for just being?<br>
                    <br>
                    Now, I may not change the whole world a better place by doing meditation every day, 
                    but by being happier and more mindful in my daily life, I can spread my happiness to 
                    people around me, which they then give to people they meet. It may sound like happiness
                    is a limited thing that we share, but it is actually a virus (good one) that can replicates 
                    and improves our life and others’ around us.<br>
                    <br>
                    We can’t control everything that happens, but we can change our experiences of those things.<br>
                    <br>
