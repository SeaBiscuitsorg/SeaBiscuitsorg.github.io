                    Well, this is a simple question. I want to be a writer when I grow up. 
                    I expect you also know what you want to do, right? You don’t?! What a shame on you! 
                    Why do you eat every day, not knowing what to do with your life? <br>
                    <br>
                    Well, hold on if you want to shout at me right now. I’m just trying to tell 
                    how I answered that kind of question when being asked. I don’t know. I don’t even 
                    think about why I can’t eat every day just because I do not know what 
                    I would become in the future. <br>
                    <br>
                    Today, I had a great conversation with … one of my friends. You know you don’t have 
                    to talk with Bill Gates or Steve Jobs (well, of course, you can’t) to get some wisdom. 
                    Wisdom is around you. It’s in your family, your friends, and even your dog can 
                    teach you something. It just depends on you to be proactive and seek to learn from them. 
                    So, back to the point, we talk about career choice, how he came to the field he is in, 
                    and why he chose it. Just for context, my friend is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science. 
                    And he chose to study Ph.D. because he wants to do R&D (Research and Development) in Computer 
                    Science and become a professor at a university. <br>
                    <br>
                    He explains his path to me until now. Studying in a university, becoming a teacher for some 
                    years in that same school, and now taking the chance to go to the US to achieve the highest 
                    academic degree. I wonder why he wants to be a teacher. He answered that he didn’t. He didn’t 
                    think much about why becoming a teacher would be great. He just applied because he wanted to 
                    have a job after graduation and have a chance to continue studying. Only then he realized the 
                    meanings of teaching. He felt great to help others and saw his students become better. 
                    He appreciated the “freedom in some limits” of teaching jobs. He could do his research and 
                    develop products with many applications while also transmitting knowledge to his students. 
                    In Vietnam, we used to have a myth about students studying to become teachers that it must 
                    have been their “last choice.” But after he spent some years teaching, he realized that by 
                    helping others with his teaching, he also received much back. But he never does that because 
                    he wants something back. It’s just his willingness and interest. So that was his path.<br>
                    <br>
                    Sometimes I think I have tried too hard to find out what I want to do. But to be honest, 
                    I just try to think about how I like this and that, without trying to do it. Then the thoughts 
                    will stop at the right moment “No, I am not good at this,” or “No, my parents will not allow 
                    me to do this.” I just think too much. The do is much more valuable in finding your career. 
                    My friend only knew what he wanted to do after trying it. So get yourself together, my fellow 
                    readers, and make a list of 10-20 jobs you would like to try. And try to do those jobs from 
                    top to bottom. Don’t overthink. You will eventually find out if this is the right one after 
                    you try every job. You may realize you do not like the job at all. You may feel this is amazing. 
                    Why don’t I think about this earlier? But let’s be straight, if you knew that already, you would 
                    have never spent time on an experiment that some anonymous guy on the internet tells you to do.<br>
                    <br>
                    Again, back to the story. Then my friend went on to give me some advice. “It’s like driving a 
                    car to somewhere,” he said, “the most important is where do you want to go.” This will be our own 
                    mission in life, or what we want to be remembered for when we died. “You can choose whatever 
                    destination you want. But you would want to find a path that has gas stations because you will 
                    need gas to run the car.” The gas is the physical being, the money, and properties we need to 
                    have sufficient life to achieve our mission. What he was trying to say is that money may not be 
                    the goal that we want to consider when choosing our career, but more of a media. It is an essential 
                    factor, but not the deciding one. <br>
                    <br>
                    So, get ready to work this bloody question out, and then the next time someone asks you the same 
                    question, you can confidently answer that, “I knew what I want to be in the future, and while I am 
                    not 100% sure I will be successful, I will try a little more each day to become closer to my dream.”<br>
                    <br>
                    I just hope that even if some humble insights I gave here will only help you be 0.01% closer 
                    to your dream, I would be 100% happier.<br>
                    Love always,<br>
                    Son.<br>
                    <br>
                    Edit: I actually don’t want to be a writer in the future, I just found great pleasure while 
                    noting my thoughts down. Thanks for reading!
